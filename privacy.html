    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 5, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>
        Outfai Ai is designed with a privacy-first approach.
        <strong>The app does not collect personal information such as name, email address, phone number, or precise location.</strong>
        No user accounts or manual registration are required.
    </p>
    <p>
        When using the App, users may upload their own photos to generate AI-powered outfit images.
        <strong>Uploaded photos may include human faces.</strong>
        These photos are used solely to perform the requested image generation task.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Face Data Usage and Processing</h2>
    <p>
        Outfai Ai processes images that may contain 
        <strong>face data (facial features visible in user-provided photos)</strong>.
        This data is processed strictly to generate outfit and fashion-related AI images requested by the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Face data is not used for identity recognition, biometric profiling, authentication, advertising, tracking, or analytics.</strong>
        No biometric identifiers, faceprints, or facial landmarks are extracted or stored.
    </p>
    <p>
        Image generation is performed using AI services provided by 
        <strong>fal.ai</strong> and fashion-focused AI models, with backend infrastructure supported by <strong>Supabase</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Generated images are stored to allow users to access their results.
        <strong>Generated images are retained for a maximum period of one (1) year.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Data is temporarily stored on <strong>Supabase infrastructure hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Asia Pacific – Sydney (ap-southeast-2)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users may permanently delete generated images at any time via the App.
        Once deleted, the content is <strong>irreversibly removed</strong> from all systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If the user does not manually delete the generated content, it is automatically deleted after one (1) year.</strong>
        This includes removal from all processing systems, including <strong>fal.ai</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Outfai Ai uses the following third-party services solely to provide core functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Supabase</strong> – backend infrastructure and temporary storage (AWS Asia Pacific – Sydney, ap-southeast-2)</li>
        <li><strong>fal.ai</strong> – AI image generation orchestration</li>
        <li><strong>Fashion AI models</strong> – outfit and fashion image generation</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> – subscription and purchase management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>User photos, face data, and generated images are not shared with third parties for advertising, marketing, analytics, or profiling.</strong>
        Data is transmitted only to the above services for the purpose of fulfilling the user’s request.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Payments and Subscription Data</h2>
    <p>
        All payments are handled through <strong>Apple In-App Purchases</strong> and managed via <strong>RevenueCat</strong>.
        <strong>Outfai Ai does not collect or store payment details, billing information, or financial identifiers.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Industry-standard security measures are applied during data processing.
        <strong>Because images and face data are deleted after a defined retention period, long-term exposure risk is minimized.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Users have full control over their generated content and may delete it at any time.
        Since generated content is automatically deleted after one year,
        <strong>no additional deletion requests are required.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Outfai Ai is not intended for children under the age of 13.
        <strong>The app does not knowingly collect data from children.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect legal, technical, or operational changes.
        Continued use of the App after updates indicates acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>
